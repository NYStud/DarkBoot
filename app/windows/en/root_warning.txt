rw_textbx0.default = Dark Boot has determined that Rootless is currently enabled on your system. Unfortunately this will prevent Dark Boot from doing anything.[return][return]You have two options:[return][return]1: To continue and disable Rootless press 'Okay'. This will cause your system to reboot. You will need to run Dark Boot again after your System reboots.[return][return]2: To cancel and do nothing press 'Cancel'. This will close Dark Boot and nothing will be changed.

# Note to self: To re-enable Rootless run this command:[return]ba=$(nvram boot-args | sed -E "s/boot-args|rootless=0//g"); sudo nvram boot-args="$(echo $ba)"; sleep; sudo reboot
